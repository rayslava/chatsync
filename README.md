[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rayslava/chatsync.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rayslava/chatsync) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/rayslava/chatsync/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/rayslava/chatsync)

Tool for redirecting chat message from one to another.

Rationale
---------

The idea is to create a small and lightweight tool for chat systems interconnection.
The first step is connect irc to tox chat. Existing python script is too heavy to run on small machines like Raspberry Pi, so the separate small and compiled tool is needed.
